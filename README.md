### Ay up! ðŸ‘‹
My name is William, but in this strange world I normally go by the alias of **MrSandyWilly**. When I'm not working on some very important and useful project, I'm probably working on some other unimportant and useless one. If I'm not doing that, I'm being lazy playing videogames, watching Netflix, or just twiddling my thumbs. That happens a lot.

### Languages
I started my computer geek journey about 8 years ago when I was given a Raspberry Pi by school and decided to use it to learn Python. Since then I've come along way...

**I'm most confident in:**
* Python
* PHP
* HTML & CSS

I use these languages for most of my projects, but give me the chance to use another language and I'll have a crack! I frequently make completely incompetent mistakes, but most of the time I like to think that I can get the job done ðŸ˜¬

### Reach Out
If you for some strange reason should want to contact me, you can either email me at **sandfojsandy1@gmail.com** or drop me a message on my Discord: **MrSandyWilly#1896**

I'll see ya around!
